## Data Analysis for Canadian Alcohol and Drug Use Monitoring Survey (CADUMS) 2012

CADUMS is a random digit-dialed telephone-based general population survey regarding alcohol and substance use, including illicit drugs, as well as prescription drugs. CADUMS targeted Canadian residents aged 15 years and older with a household telephone. The survey allows for continuous monitoring and provided rich information about alcohol and drug use, behavioral changes and tendencies, and seasonal biases. The responses reflected on policies and programs to identify places of improvement. CADUMS used RDD methods via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) to hold phone interviews to collect data. CADUMS sample represented 27,767,855 Canadians older than 14 years old. The purpose of this data science project is to 1) check for association between drinking alcohol within the past week and their sex, and 2) compare the mean smoking time between male and female respondents.
